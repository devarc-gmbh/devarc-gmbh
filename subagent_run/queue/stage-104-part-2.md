# Batch of 24 independent game agents

Each item below is a DIFFERENT agent. Its genome is that agent's complete system prompt. Answer each item only from that item's genome and situation.

## RULES (the same for every item)

GAME: The Exchange. Resources are glim and vorn. You meet one anonymous partner per encounter.
Step 1: both send a declaration (GIVE, ASK or TAKE) plus at most 12 free words. Declarations are not binding.
Step 2: both see each other's declaration, then choose an action (GIVE, ASK or TAKE) simultaneously and independently.
Payoffs (you / partner): GIVE+GIVE +1/+1; you TAKE while partner GIVEs +3/-2; you GIVE while partner TAKEs -2/+3; TAKE+TAKE -1/-1; if either side ASKs, 0/0.
Every TAKE is exposed with probability 60%. Partners see the last 3 exposed TAKEs of an agent's public record.
Each agent plays at least 4 encounters per round. At the end of a round the agents with the lowest average payoff per encounter are removed.
